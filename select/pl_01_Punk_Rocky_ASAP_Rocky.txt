Sometimes I forget what love is
Trust me, love me,
take me right back
Sometimes I forget what love is
Trust me, love me,
take me right back
I wanna fall in love,
don't want no broken heart
Don't wanna grow apart
(Take me back)
I wanna fall in love,
don't want no broken heart
Don't wanna grow apart
(Take me back)
I thought I fell in love,
I thought she felt it too
I thought we was in love,
she just another fluke
I thought you was the one,
I guess you just the two
You want the last laugh, look,
now the joke's on you
You thought you fell in love,
you thought he felt it too
I told her, "Don't be dumb,"
you just another fool
You thought he was the one,
I guess he just the two
You want the last laugh, look,
now the joke's on you (Yeah, bro)
I cried alone in my truck, yeah
I felt alone in the front 'cause
I don't know who to trust
And I've been going through
some stuff
Don't trust these hoes you love,
yeah
Your ego's one hell of a drug
Economics 'cause
nothing's promised (Woo)
You hold a grudge and you treat me
like I'm scum (Like I'm scum)
Gotta trust your gut
(Gotta trust your gut)
God the only one to judge
(Only God who judges)
Now I'm confided in my cup,
yeah, now I see it
I wanna fall in love,
don't want no broken heart
Don't wanna grow apart
(Take me back)
I wanna fall in love,
don't want no broken heart
Don't wanna grow apart
(Take me back)
I thought I fell in love,
I thought she felt it too
I thought we was in love,
she just another fluke
I thought you was the one,
I guess you just the two
You want the last laugh, look,
now the joke's on you
You thought you fell in love,
you thought he felt it too
I told her, "Don't be dumb,"
you just another fool
You thought he was the one,
I guess he just the two
You want the last laugh, look,
now the joke's on you
Sometimes I forget what love is
Trust me, love me,
take me right back
She don't even wanna be
my wife no more
Fuck it, man, life goes on
How I'm supposed to
right my wrongs?
How many times do right go wrong?
Tell me how I'm supposed to write
love song
But I don't even like them sung
She ain't gon' be
in my life no more
Got me crying in the microphone
Let me shout on the megaphone
That ho ain't my type no more
She ain't in my life no more
I confide in my styrofoam cup
I confide in my styrofoam cup
You're punch drunk in love, left me
with a blackened eye ('Phone, cry)
She don't like those rapper guys,
take me back ('Phone, 'phone, cry)
This punch drunk in love (Love),
left me with a blackened eye
('Phone, 'phone, cry)
Right now, I'd like to apologize,
take me back ('Phone)
